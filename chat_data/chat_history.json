    "response": "With the Les Mills API keys, you can access content, video metadata, and download digital assets programmatically. You can integrate this API into your mobile app to synchronize content and video metadata with your backend systems on a scheduled basis. This allows you to retrieve video-related information, query by videos, releases, programs, instructors, and more. For assistance with the integration, it's recommended to work with your internal technical team or engage external third-party technical resources."
